This project will be the GUI implementation of a hypothetical Android application called "Cableblind".
 
The general idea is that a user will be able to take a picture of an ethernet cable's exposed wires and have the application annotate the picture with the wires' respective colors. This is intended to assist colorblind people with identifying the appropriate colors of the cable pairs when dealing with ethernet.

There will be no actual logic in identifying the colors - just an application that reaches out to a non-existant server to get the information it needs to annotate the image with the identified cable colors. If this project is successful, the next step will be to implement the logic of identifying the colors, most likely with some sort of AI model.

I haven't made an Android app since college. Here goes nothin'!
