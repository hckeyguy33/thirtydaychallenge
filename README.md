# thirtydaychallenge
Thirty day challenge for coding with friends!

The goal of the effort is to grow the ever so ellusive coding chops.  

Starting Monday 7/10/2017 the only goal is to checkin new code everyday until 8/11/2017.  There's nothing other than that!  Learn a new language, do a new project, whatever you feel like doing.

Create yourself a nickname/hackername to start, push a new directory with a README.md to tell the group what you are doing.

I'm under the nickname argonaut.

There's also a private facebook group to chat on, reach out to me and I can get you added.
