I'm going to work toward a daily quote generater in as many languages as I can code into in the period of time.

I'm basing languages off of https://stackify.com/trendiest-programming-languages-hottest-sought-programming-languages-2017/ which revolves around github pushes.

I'm knocking languages I've already used day to day.

So my list will most likely be 

PHP
Ruby
C#
Obj-C
Go
R
Perl
Scala
CoffeeScript
Emacs Lisp
Swift
Javascript (if I get to it)
*Find others as needed

My design will be pretty simple
1) Redis will store quotes
2) Serve up a random quote (simple random # key)
3) Create a web page to serve (or respond to the stdout)
