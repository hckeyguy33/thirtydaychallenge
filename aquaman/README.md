I will upgrade an experimental RPi socket.io/http vanilla JS server using yeoman for setup of a react native app. Alternatives include electron and cordova for supporting target platforms.

## Goals ##
 1. Create react-native app that runs in simulator and connects to socket-io backend
 1. Target a mac app using electron
 1. Clean up socket.io server
 1. Get the mobile app on my phone
 1. Enable usage off of home network  VPN?
