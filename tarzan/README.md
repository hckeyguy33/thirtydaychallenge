This project will be the GUI implementation of a hypothetical Android application called "Cableblind".
 
The general idea is that a user will be able to take a picture of an ethernet cable's exposed wires and have the application annotate the picture with the wires' respective colors. This is intended to assist colorblind people with identifying the appropriate colors of the cable pairs when dealing with ethernet.

There will be no actual logic in identifying the colors - just an application that reaches out to a non-existant server to get the information it needs to annotate the image with the identified cable colors. If this project is successful, the next step will be to implement the logic of identifying the colors, most likely with some sort of AI model.

I haven't made an Android app since college. Here goes nothin'!

**Notes 7/11/2017:**

- Setting up an Android IDE from an existing IntelliJ installation is more cumbersome than it's worth. Just download Android studio and be done next time.

**Update 7/12/2017:**

Abandoning the Android project for now - may have bitten off more than I can chew trying to build an ambitious project while knowing nothing about Android.

Instead, I'll be working on a web application, which I'm already quite familiar with, that makes heavy use of HTML5 graphics, which I'm unfamiliar with.

The application will be a tool to help aid splitting up the cost of pizza beyond the usual "slice per person" model. It will account for other criteria, such as slice size, topping distribution, "take-home" slices, etc.
